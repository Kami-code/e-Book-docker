# e-Book-docker
This a docker version of e-Book. For more details, you can refer to [my blog](https://www.kami-code.com/2021/12/18/SE3353-assignment10/).

## Install

This project uses [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run the images. Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

## Usage

You only need to use one command.

```
docker-compose up
```

## Maintainers

~~[@Kami-code](https://github.com/Kami-code)~~

No future plan to make this docker version to keep track with the latest [e-book](https://github.com/Kami-code/e-Book) version. If you want to, you can repackage the latest e-book jar file and manually build the Dockerfile rather than using the [remote image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kamicode/e-book-docker).
